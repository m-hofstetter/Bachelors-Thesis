\subsubsection{Example Unification}

Suppose we want to join two states of a FunArray \texttt{\string{0 i\string} $\top$ \string{n\string}} and \texttt{\string{0 i-1\string} [0,0] \string{1 i\string} $\top$ \string{n\string}?}, as in \cite[example 8]{cousot2011}. The neutral elements for the join operation are $\nElement_l=\nElement_r=\bot$ The following diagram displays the arrays as little bars. The segment values are inside the bars and the bounds can be found below. Potentially empty segments have dashed outlines.

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0,0) -- (2,0);
    \draw (0,0.5) -- (2,0.5);

    \draw (0,0) -- (0,0.5);
    \draw (0,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{0,i\string}}};

    \draw (1,0) node[anchor=south] {$\top$};

    \draw (2,0) -- (2,0.5);
    \draw (2,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{n\string}}};


	\draw (5,0) -- (7,0);
    \draw (5,0.5) -- (7,0.5);

    \draw (5,0) -- (5,0.5);
    \draw (5,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{0,i-1\string}}};

    \draw (6,-0.05) node[anchor=south] {$[0,0]$};

	\draw (7,0)[dashed] -- (9,0);
    \draw (7,0.5)[dashed] -- (9,0.5);

    \draw (7,0) -- (7,0.5);
    \draw (7,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{1,i\string}}};

	\draw (8,0) node[anchor=south] {$\top$};

	\draw (9,0)[dashed] -- (9,0.5);
    \draw (9,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{n\string}}};    
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


\noindent Let us restrict the expressions to those appearing in both FunArrays as in step~\ref{item:restrictexpressions}.


\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0,0) -- (2,0);
    \draw (0,0.5) -- (2,0.5);

    \draw (0,0) -- (0,0.5);
    \draw (0,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{0,i\string}}};

    \draw (1,0) node[anchor=south] {$\top$};

    \draw (2,0) -- (2,0.5);
    \draw (2,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{n\string}}};


	\draw (5,0) -- (7,0);
    \draw (5,0.5) -- (7,0.5);

    \draw (5,0) -- (5,0.5);
    \draw (5,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{0\string}}};

    \draw (6,-0.05) node[anchor=south] {$[0,0]$};

	\draw (7,0)[dashed] -- (9,0);
    \draw (7,0.5)[dashed] -- (9,0.5);

    \draw (7,0) -- (7,0.5);
    \draw (7,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{i\string}}};

	\draw (8,0) node[anchor=south] {$\top$};

	\draw (9,0)[dashed] -- (9,0.5);
    \draw (9,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{n\string}}};    
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


\noindent This leaves no empty bounds, meaning we can proceed with step \ref{item:traverse}. We examine the first bound of each FunArray. Since \texttt{\string{0\string}} $\subsetneqq$ \texttt{\string{0,i\string}}, we insert a possibly empty neutral segment into the left FunArray as in step \ref{item:truesubset}


\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

	\draw (-2,0)[dashed] -- (0,0);
    \draw (-2,0.5)[dashed] -- (0,0.5);
    
    \draw (-1,0) node[anchor=south] {$\bot$};
    
    \draw (-2,0)[dashed] -- (-2,0.5);
    \draw (-2,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{0\string}}};  

    \draw (0,0) -- (2,0);
    \draw (0,0.5) -- (2,0.5);

    \draw (0,0) -- (0,0.5);
    \draw (0,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{i\string}}};

    \draw (1,0) node[anchor=south] {$\top$};

    \draw (2,0) -- (2,0.5);
    \draw (2,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{n\string}}};


	\draw (4,0) -- (6,0);
    \draw (4,0.5) -- (6,0.5);

    \draw (4,0) -- (4,0.5);
    \draw (4,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{0\string}}};

    \draw (5,-0.05) node[anchor=south] {$[0,0]$};

	\draw (6,0)[dashed] -- (8,0);
    \draw (6,0.5)[dashed] -- (8,0.5);

    \draw (6,0) -- (6,0.5);
    \draw (6,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{i\string}}};

	\draw (7,0) node[anchor=south] {$\top$};

	\draw (8,0)[dashed] -- (8,0.5);
    \draw (8,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{n\string}}};    
    \draw (9.2,0);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


\noindent We have now arrived at two unified FunArrays whose segment bounds are identical. Their segmentwise join is the following:

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw (0,0)[dashed] -- (4,0);
    \draw (0,0.5)[dashed] -- (4,0.5);

    \draw (0,0)[dashed] -- (0,0.5);
    \draw (0,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{0\string}}};

    \draw (1,-0.05) node[anchor=south] {$[0,0]$};

    \draw (2,0)[dashed] -- (2,0.5);
    \draw (2,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{i\string}}};
    
    \draw (3,0) node[anchor=south] {$\top$};
    
    \draw (4,0)[dashed] -- (4,0.5);
    \draw (4,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{n\string}}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\noindent Which is the same result Cousot, Cousot and Logozzo have arrived at with their algorithm \cite{cousot2011}.
