\subsubsection{Example Unification}

Suppose we want to join two states of a FunArray \texttt{\string{0 i\string} $\top$ \string{n\string}} and \texttt{\string{0 i-1\string} [0,0] \string{1 i\string} $\top$ \string{n\string}?}, as in \cite[example 8]{cousot2011}. The neutral elements for the join operation are $\nElement_l=\nElement_r=\bot$ The following diagram displays the arrays as little bars. The segment values are inside the bars and the bounds can be found below. Potentially empty segments have dashed outlines.

    \draw (0,0.5) -- (2,0.5);

    \draw (0,0) -- (0,0.5);
    \draw (0,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{0,i\string}}};

    \draw (1,0) node[anchor=south] {$\top$};

    \draw (2,0) -- (2,0.5);
    \draw (2,-0.25) node {\texttt{\string{n\string}}};


	\draw (5,0) -- (7,0);
    \draw (5,0.5) -- (7,0.5);

    \draw (5,0) -- (5,0.5);
    \draw (5,-0.25) node {$0, \mathtt{i}-1$};

    \draw (6,-0.05) node[anchor=south] {$[0,0]$};

	\draw (7,0)[dashed] -- (9,0);
    \draw (7,0.5)[dashed] -- (9,0.5);

    \draw (7,0) -- (7,0.5);
    \draw (7,-0.25) node {$1, \mathtt{i}$};

	\draw (8,0) node[anchor=south] {$\top$};

	\draw (9,0)[dashed] -- (9,0.5);
    \draw (9,-0.25) node {$\mathtt{n}$};    
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


\noindent Let us restrict the expressions to those appearing in both FunArrays as in step~\ref{item:restrictexpressions}.

    \draw (6,-0.05) node[anchor=south] {$[0,0]$};

\noindent This leaves no empty bounds, meaning we can proceed with step \ref{item:traverse}. We examine the first bound of both FunArrays. Since \texttt{\string{0,i\string}}
